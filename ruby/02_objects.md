# Objects

- Ruby is object oriented
- every object is an example(instance) of a class
- in Ruby you ask object a if it considers itself equal to b, rather then asking a == b

# Dot based message sending syntax

- in Ruby you send messages to objects and they respond if they have a method defined with that name
- . is the message sending operator
- the message on the right is sent to the receiver(obj) on the left
- an object is said to respond to a message if it has a method defined with that name
